# Cordova & Ionic plugin for PhotoEditor SDK
## Getting started

Add PhotoEditor SDK plugin to your project as follows:

```sh
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-photoeditorsdk
```

### Android

**Configuration for Android:**
Configure PhotoEditor SDK for Android by opening `imglyConfig.gradle`, you can comment out the modules you don't need to save size.

Because PhotoEditor SDK for Android is quite large, there is a high chance that you will need to enable [Multidex](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex) for your project as follows:

```sh
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-enable-multidex
```

### Usage

Each platform requires a separate license file. Unlock PhotoEditor SDK with a single line of code for both platforms via platform-specific file extensions.

Rename your license files:
- Android license: `ANY_NAME.android`
- iOS license: `ANY_NAME.ios`

Pass the file path without the extension to the `unlockWithLicense` function to unlock both iOS and Android:
```js
PESDK.unlockWithLicense('www/assets/ANY_NAME');
```

Open the editor with an image:
```js
PESDK.openEditor(
  successCallback,
  failureCallback,
  PESDK.resolveStaticResource('www/assets/image.jpg')
);
```

Please see the [code documentation](./types/index.d.ts) for more details and additional [customization and configuration options](./types/configuration.ts).

#### Notes for Ionic framework

- Add this line above your class to be able to use `PESDK`.
  ```js
  declare var PESDK;
  ```
- Ionic will generate a `www` folder that will contain your compiled code and your assets. In order to pass resources to PhotoEditor SDK you need to use this folder.
